# `aqua`

## Usage

Setup:

```bash
aqua init
```

This will create a base `aqua.yaml` file which contains the packages that can be installed declaratively.

Packages will be installed to `~/.local/share/aquaproj-aqua`

View avilable packages in your registries with:

```bash
aqua g
```

Add a package to `aqua.yaml` with `aqua g -i <pkg>`. Example:

```bash
aqua g -i minc-org/minc
```

Example:

## Contributing

Fork and clone `https://github.com/aquaproj/aqua-registry`, then run:

```bash
cmdx s <org>/<repo>
```

Example:

```bash
cmdx s minc-org/minc
```

Ensure that `docker` is running, as it is used by `cmdx`.

Then run:

```bash
cmdx t
```

Validate you can install by adding the registry for your package to your `aqua.yaml`:

```yaml
registries:
  - name: minc
    type: local
    path: ~/workspace/aqua-registry/pkgs/minc-org/minc/registry.yaml
```

and add the package:

```yaml
  - name: minc-org/minc
    registry: minc
    version: v0.1.0
```

then run:

```bash
export AQUA_DISABLE_POLICY=true
aqua i
```

and validate the package works
